# Auto power off safety timer
This box will turn off power to device (e.g., soldering iron) after set time with ability to reset timer with single click and immediately turn off with double click. The led color goes from red to violet to give a rough guess to the time left and power on/off status

I'm using an adafruit 5V Trinket which I purchased a long time ago. I'd definitly recomend using something else as it is a pain to program and there are much better alternatives now. For power I'm using an old AC USB charger. Also using a very cheap GRBW LED and relay board, both of which I'd ordered a bunch of from China years ago. The "diffuser lens" is half a ping-pong ball with a 3D printed bezel.
